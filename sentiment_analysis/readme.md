### Pipeline Stages

1. **Data Collection**: Multi-channel feedback aggregation
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, tokenization
3. **Sentiment Classification**: BERT-based sentiment scoring
4. **Topic Modeling**: LDA to associate sentiment with specific topics
5. **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities
6. **Recommendation Engine**: AI-driven teaching improvement suggestions
